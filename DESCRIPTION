Description: Inspired by the rather crazy and intense events that 
    have shaped this year, we have created a two-part package that helps to visualize 
    both election data and Covid-19 data in the United States. The `USevolve` package 
    simplifies the creation of chloropleth maps and line graphs using `ggplot2` to 
    aid users looking to create specific visualizations with the latest coronavirus 
    and US election data.
